**Problem Statement:**
Develop a job and skill hunting system by scraping job posting websites such as JobsDB, Indeed, Randstad, Robert Half, etc., to compile a comprehensive database of job listings along with their posting dates. Gather data over a 2-week period, ensuring the avoidance of duplicate entries by updating existing job postings if any parameters change. Identifying overlapping skills, create a skill matching engine that can connect skills with relevant job opportunities and cluster the most sought-after tech skills in the industry.

**Explanation:**
This project involves aggregating job postings from various websites to create a centralized database of job listings with posting dates. The data collection process spans 2 weeks and incorporates mechanisms to prevent duplicate entries, updating existing postings when necessary. By identifying common skills among job listings, a skill matching engine will be developed to connect relevant skills with job opportunities. Additionally, clustering techniques will be applied to identify and highlight the most in-demand technical skills within the industry.

**Steps:**
1. **Scrape Data:** Collect job postings and their corresponding details from JobDB, Indeed, Randstad, Robert Half, and other relevant websites, ensuring no duplicate entries and updating existing posts as required.
2. **Skill Overlap Analysis:** Identify common skills across job listings to understand skill demand trends.
3. **Matching Engine:** Develop a skill matching engine that connects relevant skills with job listings for improved job-skills alignment.
4. **Skill Clustering:** Utilize clustering algorithms to group and highlight the most relevant and in-demand technical skills in the industry.

**Business Question/Simulation:**
The project aims to address the following inquiries:
- How effective is the skill matching engine in connecting skills with relevant job opportunities?
- What are the top technical skills in demand within the tech industry based on the clustering analysis?

**Metrics for Quality:**
Metrics for evaluating the system's performance may involve:
- Accuracy of skill-to-job matching in recommending suitable job listings.
- Alignment of clustered skills with industry demand trends.
- Efficiency in preventing duplicate job entries and updating existing job postings accurately.
